### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jamie Highfield

I'm a computer scientist, with an emphasis on software & systems engineering. I specialise in web-based technologies, including **HTML**, **CSS** (**SCSS**/**SASS**), **TypeScript** & **JavaScript** (**ReactJS** & **VueJS**). I also have a long-term background in **C**, **C++**, **C#** (including the **Windows API**), **ASP .NET Core** & **Java**. Troughout my career, I have built up experience in Agile working, User Interface (UI) design, User Experience (UX) design and other software development practices. I have a passion for performance & optimisation, efficient scalability, attention to detail, as well as making use of new concepts and technologies. Some of my recent projects are listed below, including a ReactJS tree view component I am currently developing.

### :page_with_curl: Recent projects

Some of my recent projects are listed below:

- [ReactJS Nested List/Tree Component](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/react-tree-view) - a **ReactJS** & **TypeScript** nested list view / tree view like component for displaying nested or non-nested data.

[Live Demo](https://highfield.dev) (alpha)

- [SharpVNC](https://github.com/sharpvnc/SharpVNC.Core) - a .NET client & server implementation of the [Remote Framebuffer Protocol (RFB)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143). This will now be licensed proprietary for binary distributions only.
- [Mirror Driver](https://github.com/sharpvnc/SharpVNC.MirrorDriver) - Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) mirror driver for the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) - written in C using WDK. In line with industry conventions, this is licensed proprietary for both binary and source distributions.
- [Windows Credential Provider](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/windowscredentialprovider) - a .NET Framework implementation for use in Windows 7 and above.
- [Better Controls](https://github.com/sharpvnc/BetterControls) - a .NET 6 library that provides comprehensive wrappers of certain Windows API controls, where either the built-in wrappers are limited in functionality, or wrappers were never provided. These controls include Toolbar and Rebar, with full .NET 6 design-time support using the new client-server design-time bridge model.

### :page_with_curl: Other projects

Some of my other projects that are typically not feature complete, or don't intend to be finished, are listed below:

- [Meter Readings (Interview Task)](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/meterreadings) - an interview task to provide an API interface to accept electricity/gas meter readings and persist to database. This task assumed part of a wider, more complete project.
- [DapperExtensions](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/DapperExtensions) - a small library written in C# that provides automatic query generation and where expressions around the Dapper ORM.
- [Win32 GUI Calculator](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/Calculator) - intended to be a simple Win32 GUI calculator written in C++, but so far just various window creation routines.
- GDI Drawing - a .NET wrapper of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to enable high-performance, hardware accelerated drawing operations.
- .NET 6 Component Licensing - Replacement for .NET Framework's legacy component licensing infrastructure (which was not completely ported to .NET Core), which leverages the requirement that custom components must be distributed using NuGet.

### :school: University industry projects

During university, I worked on a number of industry projects that formed part of the assessment. Some of these are listed below:

- [Ambulatory Care](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/ambulatorycare-nhs) - Written in React Native and Java. This was a University industry project in a team of 5 working for the NHS to create a mobile application to aid cancer patients administering chemotherapy treatment from their home. It allowed for remote monitoring by doctors and other interactions.
