### Hi there 👋, I'm Jamie Highfield

I'm a computer scientist, with an emphasis on software & systems engineering. My tech stack includes a variety of different languages, including C#, C++, JavaScript & ReactJS, but I've primarily focussed my attention on a number of .NET projects, such as [SharpVNC](https://github.com/sharpvnc/SharpVnc.Core) (a .NET Standard implemenetation of a [Remote Framebuffer Protocol (RFB)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143) client & server) and a Windows Credential Provider (a .NET Framework implementation for use in Windows 7 and above). I have a passion for performance and optimisation, the Win32 API as well as building new projects from the ground up making use of new concepts and technologies.

### :page_with_curl: Recent projects

Some of my recent projects are listed below:

- [SharpVNC](https://www.sharpvnc.com) - a .NET implemenetation of a [Remote Framebuffer Protocol (RFB)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143) client & server. This will now be licensed proprietary for binary distributions only.
- [Mirror Driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/mirror-drivers) - Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) mirror driver for the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) - written in C using WDK. In line with industry conventions, this is licensed proprietary for binary and source distributions.
- DapperExtensions - a small library written in C# that provides automatic query generation and where expressions around the Dapper ORM.
- [Windows Credential Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/credential-providers-in-windows) - a .NET Framework implementation for use in Windows 7 and above.
- [Win32 GUI Calculator](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/Calculator) - a simple Win32 GUI calculator written in C++.
- GDI Drawing - a .NET wrapper of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to enable high-performance, hardware accelerated drawing operations.

### :school: University industry projects

During university, I worked on a number of industry projects that formed part of the assessment. Some of these are listed below:

- [Ambulatory Care](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/ambulatorycare-nhs) - This was a University industry project in a team of 5 working for the NHS to create a mobile application to aid cancer patients administering chemotherapy treatment from their home. It allowed for remote monitoring by doctors and other interactions.
