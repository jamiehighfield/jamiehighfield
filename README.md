### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jamie Highfield

I'm a computer scientist, with an emphasis on software & systems engineering, specialising in the Windows API using C, C++ & C#. I also use JavaScript, VueJS & ReactJS among other langauges, but I've primarily focused my attention on a number of .NET projects, such as [SharpVNC](https://github.com/sharpvnc/SharpVnc.Core) (a .NET client & server implementation of the [Remote Framebuffer Protocol (RFB)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143)) and a Windows Credential Provider (a .NET Framework implementation for use in Windows 7 and above). I have a passion for performance and optimisation, efficient scalability, the Windows API as well as building new projects from the ground up making use of new concepts and technologies.

### :page_with_curl: Recent projects

Some of my recent projects are listed below:

- ReactJS Nested List/Tree Component - a nested list view / tree view like component for displaying nested or non-nested data.
- [SharpVNC](https://www.sharpvnc.com) - a .NET client & server implementation of the [Remote Framebuffer Protocol (RFB)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143). This will now be licensed proprietary for binary distributions only.
- [Mirror Driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/mirror-drivers) - Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) mirror driver for the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) - written in C using WDK. In line with industry conventions, this is licensed proprietary for binary and source distributions.
- [Windows Credential Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/credential-providers-in-windows) - a .NET Framework implementation for use in Windows 7 and above.
- [Better Controls](https://github.com/sharpvnc/BetterControls) - a .NET 6 library that provides comprehensive wrappers of certain Windows API controls, where either the built-in wrappers are limited in functionality, or wrappers were never provided. These controls include Toolbar and Rebar, with full .NET 6 design-time support using the new client-server design-time bridge model. Available soon.

### :page_with_curl: Other projects

Some of my other projects that are typically not feature complete, or don't intend to be finished, are listed below:

- [Meter Readings (Interview Task)](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/meterreadings) - an interview task to provide an API interface to accept electricity/gas meter readings and persist to database. This task assumed part of a wider, more complete project.
- [DapperExtensions](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/DapperExtensions) - a small library written in C# that provides automatic query generation and where expressions around the Dapper ORM.
- [Win32 GUI Calculator](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/Calculator) - intended to be a simple Win32 GUI calculator written in C++, but so far just various window creation routines.
- GDI Drawing - a .NET wrapper of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to enable high-performance, hardware accelerated drawing operations.
- .NET 6 Component Licensing - Replacement for .NET Framework's legacy component licensing infrastructure (which was not completely ported to .NET Core), which leverages the requirement that custom components must be distributed using NuGet.

### :school: University industry projects

During university, I worked on a number of industry projects that formed part of the assessment. Some of these are listed below:

- [Ambulatory Care](https://github.com/jamiehighfield/ambulatorycare-nhs) - Written in React Native and Java. This was a University industry project in a team of 5 working for the NHS to create a mobile application to aid cancer patients administering chemotherapy treatment from their home. It allowed for remote monitoring by doctors and other interactions.
